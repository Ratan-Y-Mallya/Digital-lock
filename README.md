# Digital Lock System with Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates how to create a basic digital lock system using an Arduino Uno. The lock is controlled via a password entered through a keypad, and visual feedback is provided using LEDs. If the entered password is correct, a green LED will light up; if incorrect, a red LED will turn on.

## Components Used
* Arduino Uno
* 4x4 Keypad
* Green LED
* Red LED
* 220Ω resistors (for LEDs)
* Breadboard and jumper wires 

## Features

* Password Verification: The system checks if the entered password is correct.
* Visual Feedback: A green LED turns on if the password is correct, and a red LED turns on for incorrect attempts.
* Customizable Password: You can easily modify the predefined password in the code.

## Installation

1. Connect the Components: Follow the circuit diagram to wire the components to the Arduino.
2. Upload the Code: Upload the digital_lock.ino sketch to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. Test the System: Once the code is uploaded, enter the password using the keypad. If the password is correct, the green LED should turn on; otherwise, the red LED will turn on.
